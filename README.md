**Home Assistant – Onboarding & Activation Case Study**
A public, product-led case study analysing onboarding and activation challenges in the Home Assistant open-source platform, documented using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests (no proprietary code or data).
**Product Context**
Home Assistant is a powerful, flexible smart-home platform. However, first-time users may struggle to reach an early “aha moment”, particularly their first successful automation, creating an activation gap during onboarding.
**Problem Statement**
New users often fail to achieve their first meaningful success (e.g., a working automation), increasing drop-off risk and reducing long-term retention.
Defined in **Issue #1**
**Success Metric**
**North Star:**  
% of new users who complete their first successful automation within 24 hours of setup.
Supporting metrics include time to first device connection, time to create automation, and onboarding abandonment.
Defined in **Issue #2**  
Artefact: `docs/metrics.md`
**Solution Exploration**
Three onboarding approaches were explored:
1. Guided onboarding checklist  
2. Pre-built automation templates  
3. Progressive disclosure of advanced features  
After evaluating impact, effort, and risk, the chosen approach was:
- **Guided onboarding checklist**, supported by a small set of curated templates.
Decision documented in **Issue #3**  
Artefact: `docs/solution-options.md`
**Reflection & Learnings**
Key assumptions, risks, and next validation steps were documented, including:
- Limits of using “first automation” as a proxy for value
- Need for persona-based onboarding
- Importance of validating with real users and data
Captured in **Issue #4**
**What This Demonstrates**
- Outcome-led product thinking
- Metric-driven decision-making
- Structured prioritisation and trade-offs
- Use of GitHub for product delivery visibility
- NDA-safe, public documentation of product work
**Notes**
This case study is based entirely on public information and simulated metrics. It does not represent internal work for any organisation.
